# Zach's Protocol Repository

This repository contains versioning for my lab (and eventually field and maybe bioinformatic) protocols. They are primarily maintained as Markdown files for easy versioning and converted to pdf using [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/). I try to maintain as much of the pandoc options in the front matter as possible, so the pdfs are largely made simply with `pandoc -s protocol.md -o protocol.pdf`.
